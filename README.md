# B-learning strategies for the development of digital signal processing applications with microprocessors :iphone:

This gitbook contains a guide for conducting digital signal processing practices. It is specifically oriented for engineering where signal processing subjects are not usually seen, so the purpose of this guide is to teach some of the most important concepts in the area through real examples where the theory can be evidenced.

The topics covered in this document are:

* [Introduction](https://micros-uao.gitbook.io/libro-guia/introduccion)
* [Aspects to consider for developing DSP applications](https://micros-uao.gitbook.io/libro-guia/el-procesamiento-digital-de-senales)
* [Case study](https://micros-uao.gitbook.io/libro-guia/3.casos-de-estudio)
* [Support platform for DSP practices](https://micros-uao.gitbook.io/libro-guia/plataforma-de-apoyo-para-las-practicas)
